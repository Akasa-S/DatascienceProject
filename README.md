# Data Analysis Project
These are some of the projects I went through in the data science skill path using Python and SQL. Feel free to check! 
Below are the details:

# 1: Analyze Electric Vehicle Stations

## Description
- Exploring the different kinds of fuel, locations, and other station properties in the dataset.
- Using Boolean masks to filter the dataset down to public-access electric vehicle charging stations.
- Analyze the different kinds of ownership of public-access charging stations, determine which states have the most stations, and do a mini-analysis of the West Coast alone.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas

# 2: Analyze an A/B Test

## Description
- Analyze the effectiveness of two different ad campaigns.
- Claim: Whether the B version is outperforming the original A version
- Use Python and pandas to merge multiple datasets and perform aggregations

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

# 3: Analyzing High-Speed Railways

## Description
- Using list comprehensions to load and concatenate daily railway operation datasets
- Using for loops and if/else control flow to clean and prep the data
- Analyze the impact of holidays, distance, and weather on railway delays
  
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas

# 4: Analyze Internet Use

## Description
- Writing **custom methods** to answer some questions including:
- How long does it take for internet to reach the majority of people in different countries, regions, and income brackets?
- how much does internet usage accelerate over the years?
- how did the growth of the internet compare across the 2000s and 2010s?
  
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas

# 5: Analyze Wage Data

## Description
- Explore and analyze wage data across different industries and occupations
- Using string methods to clean the dataset and prepare for analysis
- Use pandas calculations to compute annual wages and compare each occupation to its industry average wage
- Sorting and filtering to understand which occupations are the highest earners.
  
## Technologies Used
